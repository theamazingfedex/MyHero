# MyHero
This is my first attempt at both making a game other than chess, as well as my first real application of c++.
I am following the coding sessions performed on the YouTube channel [HandmadeHeroArchive](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) beginning with [Day 001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee3EtYb8d1o), but using the VS2017 Visual C++ build process.
